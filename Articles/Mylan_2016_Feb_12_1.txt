THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RUSSELL 3000

The Russell 3000 is not well known outside the world of finance, but it’s one of the strongest indices out there for getting a broad sense of the stock market. Unlike the better-known Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500, membership on the Russell 3000 isn’t selected by committee. It’s simply the 3,000 most valuable companies in the country. 

With 3,000 stocks making up the index, it gives a broad look at the markets, including the small-and mid-cap companies that aren’t on the Dow or the S&P 500. And with a rules-based system for determining membership, there’s no bias that could potentially limit membership. That’s why many financial professionals will turn to the Russell 3000 long before the better-known indices when trying to take the temperature of the market.
