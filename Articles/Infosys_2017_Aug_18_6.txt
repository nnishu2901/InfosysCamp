"There is no change in buyback plans. We have made a commitment on how much and when to return cash to shareholders," Infosys board Chairman R Seshasayee said at a conference.

 

The share buyback — which will be the first in the company's 36-year history — has been a long-standing demand by some of the founders and high-profile former executives, who have been pushing Infosys to return surplus capital to its shareholders.

 

"None of the things that have been set in motion... will be stopped," Seshasayee said responding to a specific question on the fate of the buyback amid the high-profile departure of the CEO.

 

There are concerns that the investors' sentiments could take a beating following the ugly and public spat between the founders and the management of India's second largest software exporter.

 

The Bengaluru-based company in April had announced that it will pay up to Rs 13,000 crore to shareholders during the current financial year through dividend and/or share buyback. The company has not yet outlined the details of the proposed share buyback.

 

Share buybacks typically improve earnings per share and return surplus cash to shareholders, while also supporting share price during period of sluggish market condition.

 

Infosys had cash and cash equivalents worth over $3.5 billion on its books as of 30 June, 2017.

 

A number of tech companies have announced share buyback programmes this year to offer rich returns to shareholders.

 

While Infosys' larger rival TCS offered Rs 16,000-crore mega buyback offer to shareholders, rivals like Cognizant, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Mindtree have also made similar announcements. —PTI

Infosys' stocks fall steepest in over 4 years as Sikka quits

Scrips of global software major Infosys on Friday plummeted almost 10 percent, losing around Rs 29,000 crore in terms of market capital, post the resignation of Vishal Sikka as its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Director (MD). In the process, it pulled down two key market indices by almost one percent.

According to market observers, the fall in the scrip price of the company is the biggest since January 2013.

Stocks of the IT major plunged 9.52 percent on the BSE and traded at Rs 923.90 per share, down Rs 102.15 from its previous session's close at Rs 1,021.15 per share.

"Post quitting news of Vishal Sikka, the stocks of the company plummeted. Infosys has lost almost Rs 29,000 crore in market cap, post the news," Dhruv Desai, Director and Chief Operating Officer of Tradebulls, told IANS.

"This is the highest cut in prices since January 2013, during which the stock prices had fallen by 14.5 per cent," he added.

The plunge in the stocks of the company led the overall S&P BSE IT index to decline by 360.32 points or 3.45 per cent.

The key Indian equity indices, too, tumbled during the mid-afternoon trade session due to a heavy sell-off in the IT, healthcare and banking stocks.

Around 2.35 pm, the Nifty50 of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) fell by 79.85 points, or 0.81 per cent, to trade at 9,824.30 points.

The 30-scrip Sensitive Index (Sensex) of the BSE, which opened at 31,729.88 points, traded at 31,486.85 points — down 308.61 points, or 0.97 percent, from its previous close at 31,795.46 points. — IANS

Experts recommend Nandan Nilekani's comeback to Infosys 

?With Infosys' first non-founder CEO Vishal Sikka calling it quits, an investor advisory firm favoured Nandan Nilekani — one of the most high-profile founders of the IT firm — being brought back on its board as its non-executive chairman.

The Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) said the Infosys board has been "unable to protect its CEO" and to select a successor it must begin by "reinventing itself".

"It must convince Nandan Nilekani to join the board once again, as its Non-Executive Chairperson," it said in a report, while adding that Nilekani should not see this as any other corporate job as Infosys is at the heart of Indian IT and its success will foretell how the sector will position itself for the future.

Nilekani was one of the seven founders that set up Infosys more than three decades ago and served as its CEO between March 2002 to April 2007.

Commenting on the development, V K Sharma, Head — PCG, HDFC securities said while Infosys did better than the industry during Sikka's tenure, it was no where near achieving Sikka's own $20 billion target by 2020.

"Sikka’s allegation that he was continuously being distracted does not wash as he had long enough a honeymoon period to make his mark," Sharma said.

Market experts however believe that though this will be a near term dampener but going forward the stock will overcome the setback.

"While in near term it's a setback for the company; but given the strength of the board of the company, we believe that the company will overcome the setback," Angel Broking VP Research- IT Sarabjit Kour Nangra said.

Mahesh Singhi, Founder & MD, Singhi Advisors also said, "the move is a succession plan to the company where Sikka comes on the board as vice chairman".

Bloomberg write Andy Mukherjee also believes that Nilekani could help alleviate the situation at Infosys. "One way for Infosys to restore credibility quickly is to bring Nandan Nilekani — the cofounder who ran Infosys after Murthy, and has stayed away from the fight — back at the top of an entirely new board," he said.

As Infosys stands at the cusp of changes at the very top, perhaps now is as good a time as ever to codify a clear corporate philosophy. A set of values for Infoscions. Will the company, founded by a socialist era leader and his friends steeped in austerity, continue to run with the ‘frugality’ mantra they espoused? Even when they no longer run the show? Or will it display the quintessential image of a multi-billion dollar global business, where the top honchos show off their riches unabashedly, set off across the globe on private jets? Because, believe it or not, the current state of affairs is almost all about perceptions, it has little to do with the actual performance of the company.

Timeline of Vishal Sikka's tenure in Infosys till now



History behind Infosys row

Once a poster boy of Indian IT success story, Infosys has been battered by intense acrimony, with founders accusing the board of poor corporate governance on issues like executive pay and acquisitions.

Murthy and others had questioned the high compensation paid to Sikka as also severance package to certain former executives.

Also, an anonymous letter was sent to the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year, alleging that the Israel-based Panaya acquisition was overvalued and that some Infosys executives may have benefited from the deal.

While an independent probe absolved the board of any wrong doing, Murthy kept the pressure on making the full contents of the investigation report public. — PTI




CEO-CTO debate has put Narayanamurthy in a poor light

The CEO-CTO debate is as old as hills. A CEO is likened to a general manager who should be a well-rounded professional at ease both with technical and commercial matters an enterprise invariably gets to deal with. To be sure, a CEO should not be a nerd or otherwise obsessed excessively with his core competence lest the company is left behind by externalities including government policies, competition’s strategy as well as by simmering discontent in the rank and file and other internal factors.

But then it is equally true that while a technocrat can easily imbibe commercial, legal and financial knowledge crucial to running a modern day company, it is not possible for a non-technical person say an accomplished chartered accountant to imbibe technical knowledge especially if that happens to be the very foundation of the bread and butter functions of the company.

Here is the Infosys press release from 2014 when Vishal Sikka became CEO

There was much bonhomie and good cheer when Vishal Sikka, former member, Executive Board of SAP AG, was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Infosys in June 2014. A Ph.D in computer science from Stanford University, USA, Sikka was the first-ever Chief Technology Officer at SAP — a post created for the first time in 2007. Sikka had a longer tenure of 12 years in SAP unlike his short tenure as CEO and MD at Infosys which ended abruptly today with his resignation.



We could have delivered things no one could have: Sikka

"We could have delivered things no one could have," Sikka said. He also said that attrition had come down significantly.

"We will be important and challenging to find a successor to Vishal Sikka," said MD Ranganath, CFO Infosys.

While one of the former board members has hit out at Mohandas Pai for plotting to oust Sikka, the man has refused to react to the allegation and has instead blamed Sikka's leadership for the recent downturn in Infosys' fortunes. 

“Infosys is a company that requires deep reform; it requires restructuring of the Board urgently to restore confidence,” BloombergQuint quoted Pai as saying. The Board made a big mistake of signing an employment agreement with him, he added.

Infosys needs to set course quickly: R Chandrasekhar

Talking to Economic Times, Nasscom chief R Chandrasekhar has said that the iconic IT company needs to do the course correction as soon as possible after Vishal Sikka resigned as the CEO and MD of the company. 

"Clearly this is a very major development as far as Infosys is concerned, one which would have a big impact, it is extremely important that the leadership question in this iconic IT company is settled as quickly as possible," he told Economic Times.





In the long-running war of words with Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy, Vishal Sikka has thrown in the towel and has resigned as CEO of Infosys. However, he continues to be executive vice-chairman. UB Pravin Rao has been appointed as interim MD.


Company secretary AGS Manikantha confirmed the development in a letter to stock exchanges, The Indian Express reported.

In a press release, Infosys said: "This is to inform you that the Board of Directors of Infosys Limited (the 'Company') has at its meeting today accepted the resignation of Dr Vishal Sikka as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Company with immediate effect...appointed Mr UB Pravin Rao as the Interim-Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer."

In a short profile of Rao attached with the press release, Infosys said that Rao "has over 30 years of experience. Since joining Infosys in 1986, he has held a number of senior leadership roles including Head of Infrastructure Management Services, Delivery Head for Europe, and Head of Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods, Logistics and Life Sciences. Pravin holds a degree in electrical engineering from Bangalore University, India."

Earlier this month, Narayana Murthy had sparked a fresh row asking the management to make public a report of the audit it had commissioned on the acquisition of Israeli firm Panaya and other allegations about corporate governance at the country's second largest software exporter.


 

However, the company has rejected the demand, the report said. The internal audit was conducted by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a global consultancy firm. Infosys has made public only the summary of the findings.

Murthy has written to the Infosys board asking why senior executives such as Ritika Suri quit the company soon after the report gave a clean chit. Suri, who led the acquisition of Israeli automation technology firm Panaya for Infosys, was based out of the US. She quit the company on by mid-July.


 

A former executive at SAP, Suri was brought into Infosys by CEO Vishal Sikka in September 2014. She was later elevated as the EVP (Corporate Development and Ventures).

Infosys announced buying the Israeli automation technology company for $200 million or Rs 1,250 crore in cash in February 2015.

Apart from Suri, Anirban Dey (global head and chief business officer of Edge products) and Yusuf Bashir (MD of Infosys Innovation Fund) also quit the company over the last few months.
