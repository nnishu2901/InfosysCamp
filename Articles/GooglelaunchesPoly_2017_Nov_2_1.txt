Creators Will Love ‘Poly’ – Google’s New Open Library For 3D Objects
 
Google has recently introduced Poly, which is an open library that enables people to easily find free 3D objects for AR and VR apps.

Highlighting the integration with Tilt Brush and Google Blocks, this platform lets users to browse free models.

They will able to edit these models easily or remix them to come up with a unique version for their works.

In that case, there will be a new listing that credits and links to the original one to make sure every artist is known for their work.

Google‘s Jason Toff, a Group Project Manager for Poly, said:


In the same way today that anyone can create a webpage and, increasingly, anyone can create a mobile app, we are so far from that with AR and VR.

Part of the way we came about this idea was as we were developing apps internally, this was the biggest thorn in out sides as developers on the team.

Browse, discover and download 3D objects and scenes.

As it is shared, artists have been entrusted with creating thousands of objects, which could basically be anything that users can think!

From iceberg to apple tree; bowl of rice to common figures, such as doctor or astronaut.

What is more, users will be able to download the objects they choose, directly as OBJ files.
